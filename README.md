# Music Player Webpage

This is a demonstration of a music player webpage built using HTML and CSS. The webpage provides a user-friendly interface for playing and managing music tracks.

## Features

- **Play/Pause**: Clicking the play button starts playing the current track, and clicking the pause button pauses the playback.
- **Previous/Next**: Clicking the previous button plays the previous track in the playlist, and clicking the next button plays the next track.
- **Volume Control**: The volume slider allows users to adjust the volume level according to their preference.
- **Progress Bar**: The progress bar indicates the current position of the playing track and allows users to seek to a specific time in the track.
- **Playlist**: The playlist displays a list of available tracks. Clicking on a track in the playlist starts playing that track.
- **Track Information**: The current track's information, such as the title and artist, is displayed at the top of the webpage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the webpage and define its elements.
- **CSS**: Used to style the webpage and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the interactivity and functionality of the music player.

## Usage

To use the music player webpage, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The webpage will load with a default track and play it automatically.
4. Use the player controls to play/pause, skip tracks, adjust volume, and seek through the track.
5. Click on a track in the playlist to start playing that track.

## Customization

You can customize the webpage according to your preferences:

- **Adding Tracks**: To add more tracks to the playlist, open the `index.html` file in a text editor. Locate the `<ul class="playlist">` element and add additional `<li>` elements for each track. Modify the `data-src` attribute of each `<li>` element to point to the appropriate audio file.
- **Styling**: To customize the appearance of the webpage, open the `styles.css` file in a text editor. Modify the CSS rules to achieve the desired styling changes.
